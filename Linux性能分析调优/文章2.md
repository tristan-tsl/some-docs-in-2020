- **
  avgqu-sz**: The average number of requests issued to the device. Values greater than 1 can be evidence of saturation (although devices can typically operate on requests in parallel, especially virtual devices which front multiple back-end disks.)
- **%util**: Device utilization. This is really a busy percent, showing the time each second that the device was doing work. Values greater than 60% typically lead to poor performance (which should be seen in await), although it depends on the device. Values close to 100% usually indicate saturation.

If the storage device is a logical disk device fronting many back-end disks, then 100% utilization may just mean that some I/O is being processed 100% of the time, however, the back-end disks may be far from saturated, and may be able to handle much more work.

Bear in mind that poor performing disk I/O isn’t necessarily an application issue. Many techniques are typically used to perform I/O asynchronously, so that the application doesn’t block and suffer the latency directly (e.g., read-ahead for reads, and buffering for writes).

# 7. free -m

```
$ free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        245998      24545     221453         83         59        541
-/+ buffers/cache:      23944     222053
Swap:            0          0          0
```

The right two columns show:

- **buffers**: For the buffer cache, used for block device I/O.
- **cached**: For the page cache, used by file systems.

We just want to check that these aren’t near-zero in size, which can lead to higher disk I/O (confirm using iostat), and worse performance. The above example looks fine, with many Mbytes in each.

The “-/+ buffers/cache” provides less confusing values for used and free memory. Linux uses free memory for the caches, but can reclaim it quickly if applications need it. So in a way the cached memory should be included in the free memory column, which this line does. There’s even a website, [linuxatemyram](http://www.linuxatemyram.com/), about this confusion.

It can be additionally confusing if ZFS on Linux is used, as we do for some services, as ZFS has its own file system cache that isn’t reflected properly by the free -m columns. It can appear that the system is low on free memory, when that memory is in fact available for use from the ZFS cache as needed.

Use this tool to check network interface throughput: rxkB/s and txkB/s, as a measure of workload, and also to check if any limit has been reached. In the above example, eth0 receive is reaching 22 Mbytes/s, which is 176 Mbits/sec (well under, say, a 1 Gbit/sec limit).

This version also has %ifutil for device utilization (max of both directions for full duplex), which is something we also use Brendan’s [nicstat tool](https://github.com/scotte/nicstat) to measure. And like with nicstat, this is hard to get right, and seems to not be working in this example (0.00).

This is a summarized view of some key TCP metrics. These include:

- **active/s**: Number of locally-initiated TCP connections per second (e.g., via connect()).
- **passive/s**: Number of remotely-initiated TCP connections per second (e.g., via accept()).
- **retrans/s**: Number of TCP retransmits per second.

The active and passive counts are often useful as a rough measure of server load: number of new accepted connections (passive), and number of downstream connections (active). It might help to think of active as outbound, and passive as inbound, but this isn’t strictly true (e.g., consider a localhost to localhost connection).

Retransmits are a sign of a network or server issue; it may be an unreliable network (e.g., the public Internet), or it may be due a server being overloaded and dropping packets. The example above shows just one new TCP connection per-second.

The top command includes many of the metrics we checked earlier. It can be handy to run it to see if anything looks wildly different from the earlier commands, which would indicate that load is variable.

A downside to top is that it is harder to see patterns over time, which may be more clear in tools like vmstat and pidstat, which provide rolling output. Evidence of intermittent issues can also be lost if you don’t pause the output quick enough (Ctrl-S to pause, Ctrl-Q to continue), and the screen clears.

# Follow-on Analysis

There are many more commands and methodologies you can apply to drill deeper. See Brendan’s [Linux Performance Tools tutorial](https://medium.com/@Netflix_Techblog/netflix-at-velocity-2015-linux-performance-tools-51964ddb81cf) from Velocity 2015, which works through over 40 commands, covering observability, benchmarking, tuning, static performance tuning, profiling, and tracing.
